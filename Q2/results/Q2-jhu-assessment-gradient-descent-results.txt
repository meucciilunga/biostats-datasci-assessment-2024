# SECTION 3 - Addressing Explicit Questions of Q2
# Generally, with a smaller step-value 'e', the algorithm requires more steps to adequately 
# converge to within a given distance of an answer and is thus slower. However, results, 
# especially at each step, are also generally more accurate w/ smaller steps. Algorithm tends
# to fail when, for a fixed number of iterations, the steps are 'too small' and the initial
# guess is to far away from true value. Notably, larger step sizes also tend to trigger 
# overflow errors due to size of intermediate values involved in calculating gradient.
